				<h3>Post One</h3>
				<small>Posted by Christian on July 6th</small>
				<p> Hey man would it be possible if you made a series where we would create & launch a real functional website from start to finish? So for example, the series would start off with easier stuff like HTML & CSS, then Javascript, and then we would move on to more and more advanced stuff like setting up a functional registration form and newsletter. We would add more functionality to our site and learn more backend as the series goes on, like PHP. I feel like that's a lot to ask but just so you know i have bought one of your courses on udemy already to support you! Thanks for everything! </p>
